# xylophone_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is another practice project wherein I practice creating custom widgets (implementing what I've learned from Max's Flutter course.) By recreating Angela Yu's Flutter Development Project, the Xylophone App.

In this project, instead of using the stateless widget as how it is when the course was made with the flutter version, I learned to properly implement my knowledge on stateless and stateful widget.

So in this project to implement my custom widget(AudioPlayerBtn), I created the button to be a stateful widget so it could play my notes.
