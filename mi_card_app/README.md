# mi_card_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a project from the Flutter Course from Angela Yu's course on App Brewery/Udemy. Here I've learned more about Flutter layouts, adding custom fonts, but instead of following the one predefined in the course I decided to use GoogleFonts package instead.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
