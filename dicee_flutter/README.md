# dicee_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Created a variation of the rolldice_app from Max's course implementing the following things I learned through Mitch Koko's channel:

Creating a custom button widget(BtnRoll), and integrating a function as it's parameter data type.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
