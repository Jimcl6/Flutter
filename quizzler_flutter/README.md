# quizzler_flutter

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!

![Finished App](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Images/blob/master/quizzler-demo.gif)

## What you will learn

- Modularising your code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final.

## Notes to self

### Using the < DataType >

Using the <Datatype> allows us to explicitly declare the kind of data types we want our variables to contain. e.g. <br>
syntax:- <br>

```
List<Widget> scoreKeeper = const [
    Icon(
      Icons.close,
      size: 25,
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
    Icon(
      Icons.check,
      size: 25,
      color: Colors.green,
    ),
    Icon(
      Icons.close,
      size: 25,
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
    Icon(
      Icons.check,
      size: 25,
      color: Colors.green,
    ),
  ];
```

The list above has been declared to only accept Widgets: Now check out the code below: <br>
syntax:- <br>

```
List<String> myString = ['a', 'b' ,'c'];
```

The code above will only accept strings, if it's any other data type the list wouldn't accept it. Not unless we remove the **"<DataType>"** notation.

In order to properly create a dictionary type of list(similar to python) in dart. Here, we would have to declare a class with a constructor that would serve as our dictionary. Which we would then use to declare in our quiz_page.dart file. To begin we must first create a new file with the new class in it. <br>
syntax:- <br >

Here I used what I learned from Mitch Koko's course of properly organizing my code and files inside folders as this also helps in properly optimizing the performance of our app.
Now to begin we use the keyword class and then declare the name of our class in this case it would be named "Question"

```
class Question {
  //code block here...
}
```

Next, in order to be able to combine our questions and answers, we must first declare variables and assign the proper data types to it, now in this case our questions are strings and our answers are booleans. <br>
syntax:- <br>

```
class Question {
  String questionText;
  bool questionAnswer;
}
```

Next up, we declare our constructor([this will be explained later]()) by using the following syntax:- <br>

```
class Question {
  String questionText;
  bool questionAnswer;

  <!-- this is our constructor -->
  Question({required this.questionText, required this.questionAnswer});
}
```

By doing so, we are now able to use this constructor as pretty much of a similar method to how we declare Python Dictionaries, or in Javascript this is similar to declaring Key

## OOP Concept: Object Oriented Programming Concept:

### Class

If we were to explain this analogically, a class is similar to that of a blueprint, It's pretty much the paper, where we plan on how the product, building, structure of our app will be built.
<br>
<br>

### Object

Now an object is the actualy product, building, or (in this sense) the actual app itself. This would be the fully functional product, the actual building, what it's meant to hold, what the purpose of that building is, or if it were an app,it will be the actual button that can receive taps, or an image that can actually change,these are the actual objects, but because we can't see thte objects until our app is running.
<br>
This is the part where we plan on how it will function, how they will work, by creating these classes.
<br>

### Important things that a class has.

## Property

If we're building a car these would be it's attributes, so these would be, how many seats it has, the number of wheels that car will have, whether if it's a manual or automatic transmission car, the color of the car, basically anything that involves the characteristic of the object.

<br>
<br>

But in a programming/coding sense, these would be the variables inside our class, and thus these are now known as **Properties or Fields**

## Methods

These are the actions that the object can do. The actions that will eventually get created, will be able to perform. So in the case of our car object:

<br>

These would be, to drive, to brake, or to turn around, etc.. These methods are actions that the object will be able to do, that we will define in our class, even before the object gets built.
