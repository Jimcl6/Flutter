# magic8_ball

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

<!-- note to self: -->

In this project I'm implementing everything that I've learned thus far from Max's course on Udemy.

Implemented the Random module
Implemented coding practices by creating custom widget similar to that of the one in the course.

Implemented Google fonts for some form of aesthetic on the app itself.

Test git commit config for vscode.
